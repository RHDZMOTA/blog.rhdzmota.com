### University: Western Institute of Technology and Higher Education

Current & past students can join our slack workspace
[ITESO - Data Science & Engineering](https://rhdzmota-iteso.slack.com) by using their official university email.
This workspace is maintained by prof. [Rodrigo H. Mota][url-rhdzmota].
Review the [support guide][url-slack-support] or ask your professor if you have any problem joining.

[url-slack-support]: /404

**Why should I join the slack workspace?** If you are a current student, we'll be using a private 
channel in Slack as our main communication channel for official announcement. Moreover, complementary information
and job opportunities will continue to be shared by your professor on the public channels even after course termination.
Users (students) will not be removed after the end of semester, but you can sign-out/delete
your account at any time.

**Are there any benefits on joining the slack workspace, even as a previous student?** Yes. As mentioned before,
your professor will continue to publish complementary information and opportunities on Slack. There are also a few extra benefits you should be aware of:

* [ITESO-Industry Strategic Collaboration][url-iteso-industry]
* [ITESO-Saturdays.AI GDL Collaboration][url-iteso-saturdays]
