> All good things must come to an end.

After 4 wonderful years, I'm stepping down from my role as a university professor at [ITESO](https://www.iteso.mx/).

I am grateful to the university for the opportunity to further my career in academia and for believing in me to fulfill this role.
I am specially grateful to [Dr. Riemann Ruíz Cruz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/riemann-ruiz-cruz-792059aa/), [Dr. Juan Diego Sánchez Torres](https://www.linkedin.com/in/juandiegosanchez/), and [M.Sc. Juan Carlos Martínez Alvarado](https://maf.iteso.mx/web/general/detalle?group_id=5857927) for the continuous mentoring and support on this journey.
I am sure that under [their leadership](https://iteso.mx/web/general/detalle?group_id=13677844), the university will continue to deliver top-notch educational content and unparalleled learning experiences.

**To my former students**, I hope you've learned from me as much as I've learned from you.
From day one, you have challenge me to be a better educator and inspired me to be a better human being.
I wish you my best in your professional ambitions. Consider that even though I will no longer be part of the university,
you can always reach out to me for guidance or advice ([here](https://rhdzmota.com/courses/)).

**To my colleges**, I admire your dedication, integrity, and strength.
Being a university professor is a highly-intensive endeavor with real impact on people's lives.
You are really [shaping the minds of the future](https://www.iteso.mx/web/general/detalle?group_id=36506381).
Keep up the great work!

**Finally**, I'll be open-sourcing a refined version of my university lectures in the upcoming months.
Most of my work in based on `data engineering`, `machine learning`, and `credit risk models`.
I'll be sharing updates on this via my personal website ([rhdzmota.com](https://rhdzmota.com)) and LinkedIn Posts.
Stay tuned for more to come.
