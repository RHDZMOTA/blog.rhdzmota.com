title: End-To-End ML with Apache Spark
event: DataLab
event_url: https://www.facebook.com/events/378067359425060
location: Guadalajara, MÃ©xico
summary: From data-science to engineering with Apache Spark.
abstract: "Apache Spark has been an indispensable tool for big-data processing. It provides developers with easy-to-use abstractions for distributed processing based on RDDs. On top of that, the SparkML library empowers data scientist to train advanced machine-learning algorithms in a distributed environment. In this talk, we will go one step further and explore the bests practices for deploying and serving a SparkML model."
